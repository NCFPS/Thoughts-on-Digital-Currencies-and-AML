======================================

I submitted the following comment to the NYDFS regarding the proposed virtual currency regulations:


I am pleased to offer this commentary on DFS-29-14-00015-P, “Regulation of the conduct of virtual currency businesses.”  I am sure that, by now, the NYDFS has received much feedback on its proposed regulations. 

I would like to submit, for your consideration, a number of concerns that I have identified in the proposed regulations. I believe that I might possess somewhat of a unique background (for someone so heavily involved in the (“virtual currency” industry), at least among those who have taken the time to submit comments.(fn omitted)  I do hope that my background and insights might help inform the discussion as well as your consideration of the proposed regulations.  

My dedication to ensuring that the financial system is not utilized to further the activities of bad actors is entrenched and has been a linchpin of my career.  Yet, at the same time, I clearly grasp the essence and promise of the technology of the Bitcoin protocol.  After thoroughly reading and digesting the regulations as proposed, I have concluded that, as written, the regulations do little to ensure the safety of the “virtual currency” industry from the threat of money laundering and the financing of terrorism, while doing much to potentially choke off the growth and innovation in this still nascent industry.  Surely, this cannot be the intended result of this proposal.

THE REQUIREMENT OF A BACKGROUND INVESTIGATION IS ONEROUS

There are two main areas where I would like to focus attention.  First, is the requirement, found in Section 200.4(4), that “a background report [be] prepared by an independent investigatory agency acceptable to the superintendent for each individual applicant, and each Principal Officer, Principal Stockholder, and Principal Beneficiary of the applicant…”  

Such a requirement constitutes a potentially unsurmountable barrier to entry to fledgling start-ups here in the United States.  Furthermore, this provision’s effect on start-ups attempting to serve New York customers from distant locations, particularly in developing economies with large unbanked and underbanked populations, could be fatal.  It is suggested that careful reconsideration be given to such a broad-based requirement.  Consider for a moment, for example, would a start-up in Ghana or Tanzania necessarily have access to such an investigative firm?  If so, at what cost?  It would seem that the requirement, found in Section 200.4(5) for fingerprint submission, though still costly in certain locations, might be a more cost effective solution while being more reasonably calculated to weed out bad actors.  The requirement of a background investigation seems to be unnecessary, costly, redundant and only tangentially calculated to rooting out truly bad actors.

THE PHYSICAL ADDRESS REQUIREMENT IS OVERREACHING AND FAILS TO ADDRESS THE ON-GROUND REALITIES IN THE UNBANKED WORLD

Second, is the requirement, found in Section 200.12(1) that applicants capture and retain the “physical addresses of the parties to [each] transaction.”  This provision clearly evidences New York’s effort to extend jurisdiction over far-flung geographic areas.  As mentioned above, these geographic areas include countries where large numbers of the population are unbanked or underbanked.  Indeed, according to a 2012 World Bank report, over 2.5 billion of the world’s poor are unbanked.  In many of these countries, unlike in the United States and in other developed economies, often individuals lack a clearly identifiable physical address.  Maintaining such a requirement is tantamount to blocking start-ups in these countries, and by extension the local population, from the opportunity to fully participate in the potential that the digital currency payment technology holds for the global remittance market.  Indeed, access to affordable remittance services can prove life changing for many.  Specifically, the proposal completely seems to ignore the reality of the continuing technological developments centered on new payment products and services, particularly the use and promise of the interface between digital currencies and mobile devices in the emerging economies.

    
Clearly, access to the global payments system should not hinge on one’s ability to provide a physical address.  Mobile technology has developed to the point where fingerprint technology is now a reliable indicator of identity.  Other biometrics such as iris scans and facial recognition technology are in development (as applied to mobile platforms) and might facilitate identity verification in the mobile markets.  The proposed regulations fail to leave room for the introduction of such technologies; what’s worse, they apparently do not even contemplate them.

    
Aside from the alternatives to identity verification offered by technology, the proposal seems to ignore the fact that truly effective anti-money laundering programs are “risk-based.”  Interestingly enough, though the proposal correctly calls for the development of robust AML/KYC programs, it hastily discards the necessity of requiring effective AML programs based on robust risk assessments.  In other words, it requires risk-based (presumably) AML programs and then departs from a risk-based approach by requiring a physical address for all parties to a transaction, without regard to the risk presented.  

Even disregarding for a moment the technological “substitutes” for a physical address, a risk-based approach could be drawn to be sensitive to the types of customer verification protocols customarily accepted in a given country.  Absent that, why not consider simply recommending, as part of a risk-based analysis, lower maximum transaction thresholds and limiting the number of daily transactions available to those who are unable to furnish a physical address, or consider a combination of both?  All of these assessments are properly made within the context of a risk-based AML/CFT program.  In short, there are a number of other ways to more reasonably address the risks presented absent a “one-size fits all” mandate.  Such is the antithesis of the risk-based approach adopted by the Financial Action Task Force to which the United States is a member.

Thank you for providing the opportunity to comment and for your consideration of the views expressed herein.
